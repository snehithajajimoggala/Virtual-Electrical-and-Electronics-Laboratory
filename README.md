# Virtual Electrical & Electronics Laboratory

## Overview
The Virtual Electrical & Electronics Laboratory is a Python-based simulation tool that allows students to
perform basic electrical and electronics experiments digitally. It helps learners understand DC circuits,
AC circuits, and basic digital logic without the need for a physical laboratory setup. This project is useful 
for remote learning, practice, and conceptual understanding.

## Features
- Simulates basic DC experiments
- Simulates AC circuit responses with graphs
- Digital logic gate simulations
- User input based calculations
- Works offline and can run on PyDroid 3 (Android)

## Experiments Included

### DC Experiments
